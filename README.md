## Undergraduate_Thesis_2020
<h5>Codes and data of my BJTU undergraduete thesis in 2020. </h5>
I investigat the models which used to predict the close price of a stock issued in China's ShenZhen Stock Market, SZ.002230. I use three algorithms, i.e ARIMA, SVR and LSTM to build my six models. First three models use all of the three algorithms but use just history time series data of this stock(SZ.002230) to predict the close price of future close prcie; however, the later three models add a new factor, i.e. public sentiment towards this stock, we collect people's comment of this stock on wei_bo and Gu_ba, use sentiment analysis to engineer sentiment related features. 

Thses codes including all the work which have done, data collection, data processing, feature engineering, model building and model selection, etc.
